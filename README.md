How does EmailJS work?
EmailJS helps to send emails using client-side technologies only. No server is required â€“ just connect EmailJS to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use one of our SDK libraries to trigger an email.

Email templates can optionally contain dynamic variables in almost any template field (such as Subject, Content, To Email address, From Name, etc.) which are populated from the application code calls. For example, the subject can be "{{ name }}, you have a new message", and using your app code the name can be set to "James Dean", for instance.

Additionally, you can easily add attachments, require CAPTCHA validation, switch between email services without making code changes, review the history of the email request, and more.
